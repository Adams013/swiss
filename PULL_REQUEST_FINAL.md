# 🎨 UI Improvements: Subscription & Calculator Positioning

## 📋 Summary

This PR includes two major UI improvements:
1. **Remade Subscription UI** - Streamlined checkout flow with beautiful redirect notification
2. **Calculator Repositioning** - Moved to left bottom to prevent overlap with AI Chat

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Subscription UI Remake

**Before:** 
- Multiple steps: Click → Confirmation dialog → Click again → Redirect
- Cluttered with unnecessary confirmations

**After:**
- Single click: Click "Upgrade Now" → Beautiful notification → Redirect to Stripe
- Clean, modern interface
- Professional redirect notification

#### New Features:
- 🎯 **One-Click Upgrade** - Direct redirect to Stripe checkout
- 💫 **Beautiful Notification** - Animated notification appears when redirecting
- 🔒 **Security Badge** - Shows Stripe security information
- ⚡ **Payment Links** - All 3 plans (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly) configured
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive** - Works perfectly on all screen sizes
- ✨ **Visual Enhancements** - Better spacing, icons, and animations

#### Notification Design:
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [🔄]  Redirecting to Stripe...      ✨  │
│        You will be securely redirected    │
│        to complete your payment           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Appears at top center of screen
- Smooth slide-down animation
- Golden gradient background
- Spinning loader icon
- Auto-disappears after redirect

### 2. Calculator Positioning Fix

**Issue:** Calculator overlapped with AI Chat on smaller screens

**Solution:** Moved calculator from right to left bottom

**Layout:**
```
Before:                    After:
┌─────────────────┐       ┌─────────────────┐
│          [Chat] │       │                 │
│        [Calc]   │  →    │ [Calc]  [Chat]  │
└─────────────────┘       └─────────────────┘
