# Logo Setup Guide

## Overview
You have provided 4 logo variations that need to be saved to the project. Based on the descriptions, here's where and how to add them:

## Logo Files to Create

Based on your descriptions, you have:
1. **Small icon without text** (for favicon) - The handshake icon only
2. **Small icon with text** (192x192px) - The handshake icon + "Startup Connect" text
3. **Large logo without text** (512x512px) - The handshake icon only
4. **Large logo with text** (512x512px) - The handshake icon + "Startup Connect" text

## File Naming and Placement

### 1. Favicon (Small Icon Without Text)
- **Location**: `public/favicon.ico` (replace the existing file)
- **Purpose**: Browser tab icon
- **Description**: The handshake icon with gradient (blue and orange/brown hands)

### 2. Small Logo (192x192px)
- **With text**: Save as `public/logo192.png`
- **Without text**: Save as `public/logo192-icon.png` (optional, for use when needed)
- **Purpose**: App icon for mobile devices and PWA

### 3. Large Logo (512x512px) 
- **With text**: Save as `public/logo512.png`
- **Without text**: Save as `public/logo512-icon.png` (optional, for use when needed)
- **Purpose**: App icon for mobile devices and PWA

## Next Steps

1. Take the 4 logo images you showed me and save them to the `public/` folder with the names above
2. The existing files (`logo192.png`, `logo512.png`) should be replaced with the new versions
3. The `favicon.ico` file should be replaced with the small icon version

## Logo Colors from Description

Based on the image descriptions:
- **Left hand**: Gradient from medium orange-brown to golden-brown
- **Right hand**: Gradient from medium blue to brighter blue
- **Background**: Dark gradient from deep navy blue to dark orange-brown
- **Text gradient**: "Startup" in golden yellow/bronze, "Connect" in blue
