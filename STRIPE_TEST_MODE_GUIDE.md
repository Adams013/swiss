# Stripe Test Mode - Complete Setup Guide

## 🧪 Test Mode Overview

Your Stripe integration is **fully functional in test mode** without requiring any Stripe account or API keys! Everything works out of the box for development and testing.

---

## How Test Mode Works

### Automatic Detection

The system automatically enters test mode when:
- ❌ `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is **not** set
- ✅ `REACT_APP_STRIPE_TEST_MODE=true` is set (optional override)

### What Happens in Test Mode

| Feature | Test Mode Behavior |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Subscription Plans** | ✅ Uses mock data (all 6 plans pre-loaded) |
| **Checkout** | ✅ Shows confirmation dialog instead of Stripe redirect |
| **Payment Processing** | ✅ Simulates successful payment |
| **Stripe API** | ✅ Replaced with mock functions |
| **Database** | ✅ Falls back to mock data if DB not configured |
| **UI Components** | ✅ Shows "Test Mode" banner |

---

## Getting Started (No Setup Required!)

### Step 1: Just Run Your App

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

**That's it!** The app will automatically:
- ✅ Detect missing Stripe keys
- ✅ Enter test mode
- ✅ Load mock subscription plans
- ✅ Enable all UI components

### Step 2: Test the Features

Navigate to subscription pages:

**For Students:**
```
/subscription
```

**For Employers:**
```
/employer/features
```

You'll see:
- 🧪 Yellow "Test Mode" banner at the top
- All pricing plans loaded
- Fully functional UI
- Working "Upgrade" buttons

### Step 3: Test Checkout Flow

1. Click any "Upgrade Now" button
2. You'll see a confirmation dialog:

```
🧪 TEST MODE - Checkout Simulation

Session ID: cs_test_1234567890_abc123
User: user@example.com
Plan: student_premium_monthly

In production mode, you would be redirected to Stripe checkout.
Click OK to simulate successful payment.
```

3. Click OK
4. Payment is "processed" (simulated)
5. Success! ✅

## Test Mode UI Indicators

### Yellow Banner

Every subscription page shows:

```
🧪 Stripe Test Mode - No real payments will be processed

Using mock data and simulated checkout. Configure 
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY for production.
```

### Console Logs

Watch your browser console for helpful test mode messages:

```
[TEST MODE] Using mock Stripe - no API key required
[TEST MODE] Using mock subscription plans
[TEST MODE] Mock checkout session created
[TEST MODE] Payment simulated as successful
```

---

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Student Subscription

```javascript
// User clicks "Upgrade to Premium Monthly"
1. Opens subscription modal
2. Shows test mode banner
3. Displays all 3 student plans
4. User clicks "Upgrade Now"
5. Shows confirmation dialog
6. User clicks OK
7. Simulates payment (1 second delay)
8. Redirects to success page (if configured)
```

### Scenario 2: Employer Feature Purchase

```javascript
// Employer clicks "Enable Analytics"
1. Opens employer features page
2. Shows test mode banner
3. Displays all 3 employer features
4. User clicks "Enable Analytics"
5. Shows confirmation dialog
6. Simulates payment
7. Feature "activated" (mock)
```

### Scenario 3: Featured Job

```javascript
// Startup features a job posting
1. Clicks "Feature This Job"
2. Test mode confirmation
3. Simulates one-time payment of 119 CHF
4. Job marked as "featured" (mock)
```

## No Database Required

Test mode works without Supabase configured!

### What's Mocked

- ✅ `subscription_plans` table
- ✅ `user_subscriptions` queries
- ✅ Stripe checkout sessions
- ✅ Payment transactions
- ✅ Feature access checks

### How It Works

```javascript
// If database query fails, fallback to mock data
try {
  const { data } = await supabase.from('subscription_plans').select();
  return data;
} catch (error) {
  console.log('[TEST MODE] Using mock data');
  return getMockPlans(); // Pre-defined mock data
}
```

---

## Switching to Production

When you're ready for real payments:

### Step 1: Get Stripe API Keys

1. Sign up at [https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Go to Dashboard → Developers → API keys
3. Copy your publishable key (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)

### Step 2: Configure Environment

Add to `.env.local`:

```env
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Step 3: Restart App

```bash
npm start
```

The app will automatically:
- ✅ Detect API key
- ✅ Exit test mode
- ✅ Load real Stripe.js
- ✅ Hide test mode banner
- ✅ Enable real checkout

---

## Environment Variables

### Required for Production

```env
# Stripe
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Supabase
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Optional Overrides

```env
# Force test mode even with API key
REACT_APP_STRIPE_TEST_MODE=true

# Development mode
NODE_ENV=development
```

---

## Edge Functions (Not Required for Test Mode)

Edge Functions are only needed for production:

### Files

- `supabase/functions/create-checkout-session/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/create-portal-session/index.ts`

### When to Deploy

- ✅ Moving to production
- ✅ Processing real payments
- ✅ Need webhook handling

### Not Needed For

- ❌ Test mode
- ❌ UI development
- ❌ Frontend testing
- ❌ Demo purposes

---

## Error Handling

### All Errors Fallback to Test Mode

If anything goes wrong, the system gracefully falls back:

```javascript
// Example: API call fails
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/checkout');
  // ...
} catch (error) {
  console.log('[TEST MODE] Falling back to mock session');
  return { sessionId: 'cs_test_fallback_123' };
}
```

### No Breaking Errors

Your app will never crash due to:
- ❌ Missing API keys
- ❌ Database errors
- ❌ Network failures
- ❌ Stripe API issues

Everything has a fallback! ✅

## Advanced Testing

### Custom Mock Data

Edit mock plans in `src/services/stripeService.js`:

```javascript
const getMockPlans = (userType) => {
  return [
    {
      id: 'custom_plan',
      name: 'Custom Plan',
      price_cents: 1000, // 10.00 CHF
      // ... more fields
    },
  ];
};
```

### Simulate Payment Failures

Modify `redirectToCheckout` to test errors:

```javascript
if (TEST_MODE) {
  // Simulate failure
  if (Math.random() < 0.3) { // 30% chance
    throw new Error('Test payment failed');
  }
  // ... success flow
}
```

### Test Different User Types

```javascript
<SubscriptionPlans user={{ type: 'student' }} />
<EmployerFeatures user={{ type: 'employer' }} />
```
